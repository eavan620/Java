A number n âˆˆ N, n > 1 is called prime if it has exactly two factors: 1 and itself.
Write a function isPrime(int n) that takes an integer n and return true if and only if n is prime.
Write a function nextPrime(int n) that returns the next prime number p that is larger than or equal to n, i.e. if n is prime, return n, otherwise return the next larger prime number.
Within the main function give suitable test cases for your functions.
